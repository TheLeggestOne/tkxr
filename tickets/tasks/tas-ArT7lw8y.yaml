  Publishing to npm involves preparing your package, logging in, and using the npm publish command.  Ensure your project
  has a valid package.json with required fields like name, version, description, and main. Use npm init to generate or
  update it. 


  For public packages:

  Create an account at npmjs.com.

  Log in via CLI: npm login.

  Publish with: npm publish.

  For scoped packages (e.g., @username/package), use npm publish --access public on first publish. 

  For private packages:

  Requires a paid npm account.

  Scoped packages are private by default.

  Use npm publish (ensure 2FA or a granular access token is set up). 

  Build and test:

  Use prepublish or prepublishOnly scripts to build (e.g., npm run build) before publishing.

  Set main to the built file (e.g., dist/index.js).

  Use files in package.json to include only necessary files.

  Test locally with npm link and npm install. 

  Versioning:

  Use semantic versioning (semver). 

  Increment versions with:

  npm version patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)

  npm version minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

  npm version major (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) 

  Automate with GitHub Actions:

  Use workflows triggered on release to publish automatically. Include --provenance for supply chain security and
  --access public for public packages. 

  Common issues:

  Package name taken? Choose a unique name or scope. 

  Version already exists? Increment the version. 

  Publish denied? Ensure login and permissions are correct. 

  Cannot read properties of undefined? Avoid npm access grant for new packages; use --access public instead. 

  Always include a README.md, tests, and a CHANGELOG.md for maintainability.
