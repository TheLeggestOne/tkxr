Ensure your project has a valid package.json with required fields like name, version, description, and main. Use npm init to generate or update it. \n\nFor public packages:\nCreate an account at npmjs.com.\nLog in via CLI: npm login.\nPublish with: npm publish.\nFor scoped packages (e.g., @username/package), use npm publish --access public on first publish. \nFor private packages:\nRequires a paid npm account.\nScoped packages are private by default.\nUse npm publish (ensure 2FA or a granular access token is set up). \nBuild and test:\nUse prepublish or prepublishOnly scripts to build (e.g., npm run build) before publishing.\nSet main to the built file (e.g., dist/index.js).\nUse files in package.json to include only necessary files.\nTest locally with npm link and npm install. \nVersioning:\nUse semantic versioning (semver). \nIncrement versions with:\nnpm version patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)\nnpm version minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)\nnpm version major (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) \nAutomate with GitHub Actions:\nUse workflows triggered on release to publish automatically. Include --provenance for supply chain security and --access public for public packages. \nCommon issues:\nPackage name taken? Choose a unique name or scope. \nVersion already exists? Increment the version. \nPublish denied? Ensure login and permissions are correct. \nCannot read properties of undefined? Avoid npm access grant for new packages; use --access public instead. \nAlways include a README.md, tests, and a CHANGELOG.md for maintainability.","assignee":"use-JTYCH2se","sprint":"spr-hDifgOv0","priority":"low","estimate":5}
